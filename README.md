# chatty-uwp

Earliest frontend version of Chatty. If I were asked to version the API schema used by each
version, this comes in at v0.1. It doesn't require a server and reading/writing to the Firebase
database is done completely client-side.

#### If it isn't already clear, do not use this! It's kept as an archive for me to look back at my past self and cringe xD
